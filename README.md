## Recipes App

=======

# Getting Started with Recipes App

The application was developed using ðŸ’¥HTML, ðŸ’¥CSS, ðŸ’¥JavaScript and also preprocessor ðŸ’¥SASS. Compiled using ðŸ’¥Parcel.

I kindly ask you to try out the functionalities of the application:

- Downloading data from the server (a list of recipies) and displaying them in the front-end layer

- The possibility to send a recipe to the server using the â€˜GETâ€™ method (REST API)

- Sent recipies are automatically assigned to the user

- Adding/deleting recipied from bookmarks (local storage)
-

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all dependencies and packages.

### `npm start`

Launches the app. Server running at ([http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234)).
